An explorer dashboard of all cosmos-sdk based blockchains run by woogieboogie, forked from Ping.Pub explorer

## What the Dashboard apart from other explorers?
**Forked from Ping Dashboard** stands out by providing a real-time exploration of blockchain data without relying on caching or pre-processing. It exclusively fetches data from the Cosmos full node via LCD/RPC endpoints, ensuring a truly authentic experience. This approach is referred to as the "Light Explorer."
