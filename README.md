## What sets the Dashboard apart from other explorers?
**The Dashboard was Forked from Ping Dashboard**<br>
The dashboard stands out by providing a real-time exploration of blockchain data without relying on caching or pre-processing. It exclusively fetches data from the Cosmos full node via LCD/RPC endpoints, ensuring a truly authentic experience. This approach is referred to as the "Light Explorer."
